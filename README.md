# UCLA Design System

This is a HTML and CSS starter kit to build themes based on the UCLA design system. This kit is simple by design. It includes color swatches, typography, icons and a spacing system. This CSS presentation layer can be ported to various content management systems popular at UCLA. If you create a theme based on this template please add a link to the resource page or post an issue with the url and we can include it as a campus resource.



## Built with scss partials and stylelint. 

Instructions:

- `npm install`

## Fractal, storybook and patternlab 
Fractal is included now and we may add storybook and patternlab. We also are using codepen to develop components.
